# Anomalous Zone Plugin  

This repository contains the custom Exiled plugins used on **The Anomalous Zone** SCP:SL server.  
Since the server is no longer active, I've decided to make the code public for others to use and learn from.  
However, you probably came for the **Funny Pills** (*or the unhinged comments*) – My most popular addition, which kept players on while the server was still active.  

⚠ **Disclaimer:** The project includes a lot of unfinished and experimental code, so some features may not work as expected.  
However, the repository consists of over **10,700 lines of code across 70+ files**!  


## License & Credit  
You're free to use and modify this code, but **please provide credit** to me **Logan "coollogan876" Dresel** and **The Anomalous Zone**.
